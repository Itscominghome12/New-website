  <h5 class="timet">If people don't get rehabilitated after cancer it can affect their ability to work, their families, their physical, emotional and social wellbeing and their long-term health. Cancer rehabilitation and exercise can reduce side effects of the disease and debilitating cancer treatments, and can improve functional ability, quality of life and ultimately, survival.</h5>
